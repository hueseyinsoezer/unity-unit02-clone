# unity-unit02-clone
In this clone i share unit 2 of Junior Programmer from Unity source.  
This open source code contains functions which is about movement, keeping the player inbounds and cleaning up of code and variables. 
Firstly i downloaded the scene and imported the prototyp2 starter files. Than i dragged the objects which are human, food and animals.
At the end of first lesson i give movement to player and bound the player movement for x coordinates.
